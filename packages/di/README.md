# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside
of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of
the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.
